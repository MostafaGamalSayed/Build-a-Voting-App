## About
In this workshop, I built a voting app, similar to UserVoice, that allows you to create ideas, vote and comment on them, sort and filter the results, and even administer the site. I started from scratch and work through the entire process, including implementing the design, working on all of the features, testing our code, and more.

## Tools
I used the stack (Laravel 8, Vue 2 and Tailwind 2) in this particular project.
